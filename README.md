# Time series forecasting
Time series are one of the most important concepts in the world of artificial intelligence, which have special applications in this field. From predicting customer behavior in business-to-consumer (B2C) businesses to predicting stock prices and the value of various markets, all are among the applications of time series.
This repo is dedicated to examining time series and its types. This repo may be useful for people interested in algorithmic trading and artificial intelligence activists.
